# Front-End Web Development Training

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). The plots were created with [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/), including the [annotation plugin](https://www.chartjs.org/chartjs-plugin-annotation/) for the extra line annotations, and the [datalabels plugin (beta version)](https://www.chartjs.org/chartjs-plugin-annotation/) for labelling datapoints.
